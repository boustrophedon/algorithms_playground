# E266 is multiple # in a comment, which I use for headings
# E501 is line length, which black is in charge of and flake8 produces false
# positives for long comments, esp. ones with long URLs (this has something to
# do with a bug in PEP8)
# E402 is module imports not at the top of the file, which I use to import pytest and hypothesis where the tests are at the bottom of the files. This is intentional.
